2. Sorting: Sort the occupants based on their weight in descending order. The heaviest individuals should be placed    first, followed by the lighter ones.
3. Grouping: Divide the sorted occupants into three groups: "heavy," "medium," and "light," based on their relative    position (front, middle, back).
4. yBench Placement: Start with the heaviest occupants and place them alternately on the left and right seats, starting     with the middle. Ensure that the weight is evenly distributed on each side.
5. Optimization: After each placement, check if the weight distribution on both sides is balanced. If not, attempt to  exchange occupants within the groups to achieve balance. You can use various strategies, such as swapping the    lightest occupants or swapping occupants with similar weights.
6. Iteration: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until an optimal weight distribution is achieved or no further improvements are     possible.
7. aResult: Output the optimal seating arrangement where the weight is evenly distributed on both sides, and the heaviest   individuals sit in the middle.
